## heart-engine-playground | [![CI](https://github.com/growlitheharpo/heart-engine-playground/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/growlitheharpo/heart-engine-playground/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

This is a tech playground for a "game engine" called Heart.

Notable components include **heart-codegen** and the deserialization component of heart-core; these two items play off each other (as well as entt and rapidjson) to create powerful loading capabilities with minimal markup. The output of this process can be found in the [artifacts for the CI](https://github.com/growlitheharpo/heart-engine-playground/actions?query=workflow%3ACI).

Graphics are driven by SFML. Premake is used for project generation.
