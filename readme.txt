This is a tech playground for a "game engine" called Heart.

Notable components include heart-codegen and the deserialization component of heart-core; these two items play off each other (as well as entt and rapidjson) to create powerful loading capabilities with minimal markup.

Graphics are driven by SFML. Premake is used for project generation.
